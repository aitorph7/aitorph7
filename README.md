**I am Aitor,** passionate about physical activity and well-being.

My passion for challenges has extended to the world of programming, which is why during the second half of 2023 and the first half of 2024 I studied **Web Development with a special focus on Java**‚òïÔ∏è.

Right now I'm immersed in a training process in **Artificial Intelligence**ü§ñ.
